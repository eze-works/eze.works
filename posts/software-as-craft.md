I recently listened to a podcast that solidified something I have often thought: The term "software engineer" is a misnomer.

The episode in question is an interview with [Greg Wilson](https://third-bit.com/), a programmer turned teacher. The episode is called "Programming and Industrial Design with Greg Wilson". Around the 19:35 mark, Greg makes the point that the practice of writing software has more in common with industrial design than any of the other real engineering professions. After ruminating on this for a day, I think I agree, but there is a little bit of nuance I would like to add.

Industrial design is the planning that goes into producing a functional product in a standardized, repeatable manner. Imagine you are designing a car factory: Your goal is to plan things such that you can churn out your standard models in as automated a way as possible.

Before industrial design was a thing though, artisans and craftspeople made the products. Think of a local shoemaker: Their goal is most definitely not to crank out a large amount of standardized shoes. Their business is more of a way of life.

I think these two paradigms are mirrored in the software world. There are "Software Industrialists" and there are "Software Artisans". The industrialist's job is to produce maintainable and scalable software, usually on behalf of a company in pursuit of some business goal; it is more of a means to an end. For artisans however, software is part of their identity. There is fulfillment and ✨vibes ✨ to be had in writing elegant code.

I skew _hard_ on the artisanal side, so the thought that my work is not too dissimilar from that of a sculptor like Michelangelo is a nice (albeit crazy) one.
